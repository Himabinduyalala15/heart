HEART DISEASE DETECTION

Heart disease detection involves using medical data and diagnostic techniques to identify the presence of cardiovascular conditions.
Advanced methods often employ machine learning algorithms trained on extensive datasets to predict heart disease risk with high accuracy. Early detection is vital for effective treatment.

THIS DATASET CONTAINS:
1.Age: Patient's age.
2.Gender: Patient's gender.
3.Chest Pain Type: Type and severity of chest pain (e.g., typical angina, atypical angina, non-anginal pain, asymptomatic).
4.Resting Blood Pressure: Patient's blood pressure at rest.
5.Cholesterol Levels: Total cholesterol measurement.
6.Fasting Blood Sugar: Fasting blood sugar levels (>120 mg/dl).
7.Resting ECG Results: Electrocardiogram readings at rest (e.g., normal, ST-T wave abnormality).
8.Max Heart Rate Achieved: Maximum heart rate during exercise.
9.Exercise-Induced Angina: Presence of angina induced by exercise (yes/no).
10.ST Depression: Depression in the ST segment of ECG after exercise compared to rest.
11.Slope of the ST Segment: The slope of the peak exercise ST segment (e.g., upsloping, flat, downsloping).
12.Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy: Number of major vessels (0-3) colored by fluoroscopy.
13.Thalassemia (Thal): Thalassemia status (normal, fixed defect, reversible defect).
